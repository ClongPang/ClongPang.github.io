Hello, I am Chenglong Pang. I am a currently master's student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Donghua University. Interestingly, I have an interdisciplinary background.  I completed my undergraduate studies in Big Data Management and Application at the School of Management, Guangdong University of Technology.

My research interests focus on graph learning, recommender system. Recently, I have been concentrating on the application of AI models in recommendation systems:  
(1) Utilize AI to understand user intentions in recommendation scenarios;  
(2) Behavior-based user personality simulation generation.
